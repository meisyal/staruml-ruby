# staruml-ruby

staruml-ruby is a Ruby extension for [StarUML][staruml]. This extension helps
you to generate Ruby code from a UML class diagram. For example, you have a
class called `Book`.

![Book class](https://res.cloudinary.com/daokp8cnd/image/upload/v1540477871/staruml-ruby/book-class.png)

staruml-ruby will generate code below:

```ruby
class Book
  def initialize(name, price, qty)
    @name = name
    @price = price
    @qty = qty
  end

  private
    attr_accessor :name, :price, :qty

  def to_s
    "Your string representation of the object will be written here."
  end
end
```

## Current Status

This extension currently supports generating Ruby code from a UML class diagram.
Reverse engineering from Ruby code to a UML class diagram is not supported at
the moment.

Please, refer to [Supported UML concepts][umlconcept] page for futher details.

## Installation

The simplest way to install staruml-ruby is from StarUML extension repository.
This installation method is explained as follows:

StarUML extension repository stores extensions that officially registered.
Because of it, I **highly recommend** to use this installation method.
Registered extensions are available on [this page][starumlextension].

See [Installation][installation] for other installation methods.

## Usage

4. Press **Open** button.

## Configuration

You can configure the extension before generating the code. The configuration
handles how the generated code looks like. Indentation of code and code comment,
for example. This is supported by this extension to generate Ruby code, as
you prefer.
